# Insertion Sort
### Challenge 
Implementation of insertion sort algorithm in Ruby and understanding of Big O Notation

***

#### What is insertion sort?
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.

#### When/why would I use it over other ways of sorting?

* Simple implementation
* Efficient for small data sets
* Adaptive
* Stable
* In-place
* Online

#### What are the best, worst, and average Big O Scenarios?

* **Best**: O(n) (sorted array)
* **Worst**: O(n<sup>2</sup>) (reverse-sorted array)
* **Average**:O(n<sup>2</sup>)
